I have quiet a bit of knowledge pertaining to draft horses and hitches. I have done quiet a few projects on the subject and I feel comfortable with the slang. We have two at our house, so I know their disposition and typical behavior. They are both female, stand about 17 hands tall. One has a slight hip problem. They are both bay and have white blazes and white socks. What they eat. Clydesdales are used by Budwiser for their strengh and beauty. A typical health problem with large horses is thrush in the feet. It is where the hoof has an infection for being too damp. A majority of top animals in this breed come form Anderson Farms, Five Star Clydesdales, and Ridgeview. Just a few parts of a harness is bridle, saddle, briching, and crupper. There are wagons for every event imaginable. The parts of a wagon people forget most is the neck yoke. They stand usually between 16-19 hands. The feathering around the hooves are a must.
